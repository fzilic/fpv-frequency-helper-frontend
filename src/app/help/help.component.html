  <h3>Why use this tool</h3>
  <p class="lead">If you fly FPV with buddies you have found yourself in this situation: </p>

  <p>It is a nice day to fly, you pick up your gear and meet your buddies at common flying place. They have already
    picked
    up channels that work for them, but you also want to fly with them.</p>
  <p>And to make things more interesting there that one pilot with broken goggles/VTX who can only pick one channel or
    band (if you are lucky).</p>
  <p>Instead of trying to figure out a correct frequency combination for all of you to fly together just let this app
    figure things out</p>

  <h4>And how to use it</h4>

  <figure class="figure">
    <p>Pick which bands are legal where you fly (or mostly legal) by tapping on "Bands" and selecting/deselecting bands
      you want to use.</p>

  <figure class="figure">
    <p>Selected bands are shown within parenthesis.</p>

  </figure>

  <figure class="figure">
    <p>Add pilots by tapping that big green plus sign. Current number of pilots is show within parenthesis. Also,
      tapping
      on "Pilots" will expand pilot section. Also, you can set a nickname for each pilot if that is your thing.</p>

  </figure>

  <figure class="figure">
    <p>Tapping on band name for pilot will show all channels. You can choose individual channels for each band.</p>

  </figure>

  <figure class="figure">
    <p>Or simply select all channels within a band by tapping check-mark. When all channels within a band are selected
      for
      a pilot, check-mark will turn black.</p>

  </figure>

  <figure class="figure">
    <p>When everything is selected, bit yellow check-mark button will ask the server to find something that could work
      for
      you. Give it some time, it is not easy to search trough all those combinations. Results will show minimum
      separation
      between channels and minimum separation from any IMD frequency.</p>
